LollipopDrawerToggle
====================

Sample code for using the appcompat v7 ActionBarDrawerToggle class with a
navigation drawer. Uses the new Toolbar API to provide an ActionBar to the
ActionBarActivity. Note that we are required to use the support library
ActionBar interface here. Includes the new Material design hamburger button to
up arrow animation on slide of the drawer. This is the animation used in Google
apps such as the Play store and Photos. You may want to checkout Chris Renke's
version of the icon animation (http://chrisrenke.com/drawerarrowdrawable) which
surfaced slightly before the AppCompat library was updated.
