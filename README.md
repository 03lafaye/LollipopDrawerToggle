LollipopDrawerToggle
====================

Sample code for using the appcompat v7 ActionBarDrawerToggle class with a
navigation drawer. Uses the new Toolbar API to provide an ActionBar to the
ActionBarActivity. The master branch uses an ActionBarActivity and a v7
Toolbar, the no-v7-support branch uses the ActionBarDrawerToggle with a
standard framework Activity and Toolbar. Includes the new Material design
hamburger button to up arrow animation on slide of the drawer. This is the
animation used in Google apps such as the Play store and Photos. You may want
to checkout Chris Renke's version of the icon animation
(http://chrisrenke.com/drawerarrowdrawable) which surfaced slightly before the
AppCompat library was updated.
